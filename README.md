# üè°Coffee Machine Simulator

The Coffee Machine Simulator is a Java console application that simulates the operations of a coffee machine. It allows users to buy different types of coffee, fill ingredients, take money, and view the remaining ingredients. Additionally, it provides analytics on the number of coffees sold, the amount earned, and the ingredients consumed.

## üòäFeatures

- **Buy coffee:** Users can select from the available types of coffee (espresso, latte, cappuccino) and purchase their desired coffee. The program checks if there are sufficient ingredients to make the selected coffee and dispenses it if possible.

- **Fill ingredients:** Users can add water, milk, and coffee beans to the coffee machine. This feature allows for replenishing the ingredients as needed.

- **Take money:** The coffee machine has a money box where all the earned money is stored. This feature allows the maintainer to retrieve the money from the money box.

- **Show ingredients:** Users can check the current quantities of water, milk, coffee beans, and the amount of money in the coffee machine.

- **Analytics:** The program provides statistics on the number of each type of coffee sold, the total amount earned, and the total quantities of water, milk, and coffee beans consumed.
